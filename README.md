# Functional and Object-Oriented Programming

In this part of the tutorial,  I have compiled the R codes and outputs of functions which I learned and tested during the **Advance R Programming**
course with *coursera*. 

## Part 1: Factorial Function

For this part four different type of factorial functions are presents

1. Factorial_loop: a version that computes the factorial of an integer using looping (such as a for loop)

2. Factorial_reduce: a version that computes the factorial using the reduce() function in the pure package. Alternatively, you can use them
Reduce() function in the base package.

3. Factorial_func: a version that uses recursion to compute the factorial.

4. Factorial_mem: a version that uses memoization to compute the factorial.

## Part 2: Longitudinal Data Class and Methods

The purpose of this part is to create a new class for representing longitudinal data, which is data that is collected over time on a given
subject/person. This data may be collected at multiple visits, in multiple locations.

The following functions have been implemented in this session 

1. make_LD: a function that converts a data frame into a “longitudinal data” object

2. subject: a generic function for extracting subject-specific information

3. visit: a generic function for extracting visit-specific information

4. room: a generic function for extracting room-specific information

## Acknowledgement

I would like to give my sincere gratitude to the Coursera and John Hopkins University for giving me an opportunity to do Advance R Programming course with them. I would like to say special thanks to tutors  **Roger D. Peng**, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Biostatistics and 
**Brooke Anderson**, Assistant Professor, Environmental & Radiological Health Sciences.
